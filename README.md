# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a **Crop Yield Prediction System** that uses **Python**, **Machine Learning**, **SQL**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Flask** to forecast crop yields based on multiple agricultural factors. It is designed to help farmers, researchers, and agricultural planners make informed decisions for better crop management and productivity.

---

## 📈 Key Features

- Predicts crop yield using input factors like:
  - Water usage
  - UV index
  - Region
  - Fertilizers
  - Crop type
  - Cultivation area
  - Pesticides
  - Technology adoption
- Trained with **classification algorithms** for accurate predictions.
- Easy-to-use **web interface** built with Flask.
- Stores and manages data in a **SQL database**.

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **Python** — for data handling, model building, and backend logic.
- **Machine Learning** — classification algorithms for yield prediction.
- **Flask** — lightweight Python web framework for the application.
- **SQL** — database for storing input data and results.
- **HTML & CSS** — for front-end web design.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Enable farmers and agricultural planners to predict crop yields based on real factors.
- Support better planning of water, fertilizer, and other resources.
- Demonstrate practical use of **machine learning** in agriculture.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User provides crop details and agricultural parameters through a web form.
2. The system processes the input and uses a trained machine learning model.
3. The predicted yield is displayed to the user on a simple, clean web page.
